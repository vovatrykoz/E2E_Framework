 * - Task reading and generation.
 * - Reading and managing task instances.
 * - Analytical tools for evaluating timed path reachability.
 * - End-to-end delay calculations.
 *
 * It serves as the core of the framework, providing functionality to model and

/**
 * @namespace e2e::analysis
 * @brief Namespace providing tools for path filtering and delay analysis.
 *
 * The `analysis` namespace offers functionalities for analyzing sets of
 * `TimedPath` objects. It includes methods for:
 * - Filtering unreachable paths based on reachability conditions.
 * - Removing paths that produce duplicate values due to identical start times.
 * - Identifying the path with the maximum end-to-end latency.
 * - Calculating overarching delays using various timing semantics.
 * - Determining predecessor paths based on activation time and path period.
 *
 * This namespace serves as a key component for path-based analysis in the
 * framework, enabling precise evaluation and optimization of timing and
 * reachability.

/**
 * @namespace e2e::mathframework
 * @brief Namespace providing mathematical and logical functions for task
 * instance analysis.
 *
 * The `mathframework` namespace contains critical functions for evaluating the
 * relationships and interactions between task instances in a system. These
 * functions are integral to determining:
 * - Activation time travel (whether a reader task activates before a writer).
 * - Overlap in execution between writer and reader tasks.
 * - Wait conditions based on task priorities during overlapping execution.
 * - Forward reachability between tasks, accounting for time travel and
 * criticality.
 * - Detection of overwrites between writer task instances for the same reader
 * task.
 * - Reachability of an entire timed path of task instances.
 *
 * These utilities form the foundation for analyzing temporal and logical
 * properties of task sets, enabling precise evaluation of scheduling and timing
 * in complex systems.

 * chains.
 * - Generate task instances from tasks in an end-to-end path.
 * - Construct timed paths based on task instances and their dependencies.
 * - Perform operations like Cartesian product to build complex path
 * combinations.
 *
 * This namespace is crucial for tasks related to time-based path construction,
 * enabling efficient and accurate scheduling analysis.
